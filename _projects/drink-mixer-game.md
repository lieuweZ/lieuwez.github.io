## Overview

A score-based puzzle game with grid mechanics where players mix falling ingredients to create drinks for customers. I implemented a custom system for falling tiles and ingredient movement, inspired by classic match-3 games but with a unique bartending twist.

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- Grid-based logic for placing and matching ingredients
- Falling animations and smooth movement between tiles
- Custom sprite design for all ingredients and UI elements
- Recipe combination system with dynamic customer orders

## Concept

The core gameplay combines the familiar match-3 mechanic with a bartending theme. Players match ingredients on a grid to create drink recipes for waiting customers. Each customer has specific drink orders that need to be fulfilled within time limits or move constraints.

## Target Audience

Young adults aged 16-26, both experienced and new gamers. The game features multiple difficulty levels to accommodate different skill levels.

## Game Design Pillars

### Replayability
The game is designed to be endlessly replayable with no clear endpoint, allowing players to extract maximum enjoyment without requiring massive content creation.

### Simplicity
Easy to understand mechanics ensure accessibility for all players, including those who don't typically play mobile games.

### Social
Social features encourage players to share progress and compete, driving engagement and attracting new players through word-of-mouth.
