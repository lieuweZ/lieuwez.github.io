**A score-based puzzle game with grid mechanics where players mix falling ingredients to create drinks for customers.**

I implemented a custom system for falling tiles and ingredient movement, inspired by classic match-3 games but with a unique bartending twist.

## Gameplay

Players match ingredients on a grid to create drink recipes for waiting customers. Each customer has specific drink orders that need to be fulfilled within time limits or move constraints.

**Core Features:**
- Grid-based matching with falling ingredients
- Recipe system combining specific ingredients into drinks
- Customer orders with time-based challenges
- Multiple difficulty levels for different skill levels

## My Contributions

- Grid-based logic for placing and matching ingredients
- Falling animations and smooth movement between tiles
